# The Space Blocks

This project is the first game project I made using the Unity Game Engine and also the midterm project of the GAME106 course.The theme, scripts and level designs of the game are completely mine. The sprites used are not mine.I wanted to add a more vintage feel to the game by using the space theme.

**For the game to be easy to examine and test, I added level buttons to the main menu so you can switch to the level you want from the menu and play the game.**

# About The Game

On the start screen of the game, you can choose the spaceship you want and play the game.

You only have one life in the game, so you have to finish the game before you die.

There are 5 different levels in The Space Block and the difficulty of the levels varies depending on the progress. In the last level, meteorites are falling and you should not hit them!
